# Student Bio Page

In this activity, you will create a simple HTML page to serve as a personal bio.

## Instructions

* Create a simple bio page for yourself by using the following HTML elements:

  * A header that will store your name inside of it.

  * An image that will act as a stand-in for your picture, with an `alt` attribute that provides a basic description of the image.

  * Two paragraphs that will have text describing who you are.

  * An unordered list of links to your social media pages.

  * A table that will contain three columns and some data on your favorite movies, songs, books, or activities.

## Hint

* Placeholder images can be found at [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos/), and placeholder text can be found at [lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com/). Try to get the entire page working before diving into more specific text and images.

## Bonus

* Look into how one might go about linking one custom-made HTML page to another. Once you have found out how, try creating a link from the bio page you have just created to one of the pages you created last class.
